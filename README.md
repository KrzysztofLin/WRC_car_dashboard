# WRC_car_dashboard
Interactive dashboard created in Plotly and Dash to visualize the trail and acting forces of the WRC car. 

# The goal 
The goal of this task was to create interactive dashboard, which would be useful tool for rally rider to analysis rider's performance and improve rider's style.

The dashboard would be also great tool for mechanic, it can provide data of the acceleration occurred during rider's training and in case of malfunction detect it's origin (or prevent further damage).

# About data set
Data set has been created based on data collected (meausured) during my friend Tomek's training on the WRC track in Włocławek. The data set contains information about:
- geolocalization of the vehicle,
- accelerations of the vehicle,
- time,
- lap number.
